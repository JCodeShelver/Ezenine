# **Ezenine**
This repository contains the source code for my Discord bot, Ezenine.

## Purpose
Ezenine as it stands is for private use on my own server. There are some pieces of code that use specific ID's from my server.  
The reason I have uploaded the source code for all to see is:  
* Have a backup online  
* Allow others to reference/copy+paste my code for their own development  

## Using my code
I have no qualms with anyone who downloads my code, it is open source.  
If you do use my code in its entirety however, you will want to add some .json files present in my local copy.  
* A _users.json_ file within the cog directory.
* A _settings.json_ file within the root directory.
* A _sessions.json_ file within the cog directory.  

The entries needed in each .json file can be found in the code itself (I can't be bothered to document that right now).

## Contributing
I personally do not have enough spare time to manage contributions, from documenting guidelines to actually making sure they are useful.  
Due to this, unless explicitly asked for contributing, please do not attempt to contact me for contributing.
